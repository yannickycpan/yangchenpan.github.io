I am Yangchen Pan ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=QyAsyYEAAAAJ&hl=en)), a PhD candidate in the Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta. 
My PhD advisors are Dr. [Martha White (University of Alberta)](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/) and Dr. [Amir-massoud Farahmand (University of Toronto & Vector Institute)](http://academic.sologen.net). 
I am broadly interested in machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. So far, I have been working on the following topics. 

- Reinforcement learning
   - Policy evaluation problems: approximate second-order method
   - Control problems
      - Search-control/hypothetical experiences generation in model-based reinforcement learning
      - A special class of PDE control problems: dealing with arbitrarily high-dimensional continuous action space
      - Bias-variance control in Q-learning
- Deep learning
   - Representation interference/catestrophic forgetting problem: a natural sparsity direction
- Conventional machine learning
   - Parametric modal regression
   - Semi-supervised learning: how to leverage unlabled data to improve generalization
